# Code for article *Progressive State Space Disaggregation for Infinite Horizon Dynamic Programming*


How to use the repository in few steps :
- clone the repository
- cd state_space_disaggregation
- pip install -r requirements.txt
- python main.py
- observe results in results/discounted_avg_runtime_ICAPS_agg_0.xlsx

- weakly-couplet garnets

Remarks :
- Whole experimence takes several days as runtime is measured on 10 experience for each model and each solver
- discount = 0.999, epsilon = 1e-3
- All solvers are implemented in the "solvers" folder, and all models in the "models" solver
